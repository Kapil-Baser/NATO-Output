## NATO Output
This little toy project is from book "Tiny C Projects by Dan Gookin" - [Tiny C Project](https://www.manning.com/books/tiny-c-projects)

What I learned from this project
- Parsing files and texts using C.
- Reading a file and translating it into NATO phonetic alphabet.
- Traslating NATO phonetics to words.
- Reading a file containing NATO alphabets and translating that to words.
